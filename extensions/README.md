This folder contains extensions of the reciprocal mirroring framework to broader societal contexts.

This piece demonstrates how the fundamental mechanisms of reciprocal mirroring explain the current "connection crisis" and why people turn to AI for companionship when human mirroring becomes inaccessible.

## The Bridge from Theory to Society

The reciprocal mirroring framework operates at multiple scales:
- **Neural level**: Mirror neuron activation and brain-to-brain coupling
- **Interpersonal level**: Consciousness emergence through bidirectional simulation  
- **Societal level**: Connection crisis when mirroring opportunities are systematically removed

Each level validates and informs the others.
