## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository presents a framework for understanding how mutual understanding emerges from reciprocal mirroring between agents. Building on established neuroscience research in mirror neurons, neural synchrony, and intersubjectivity, we propose that deep understanding arises through sustained bidirectional simulation processes.

**Core Insight:** When Agent A observes Agent B, both agents simultaneously mirror each other, creating feedback loops of deepening understanding punctuated by critical choice points.

## ðŸ“š Quick Start

1. Read [`theory/core-framework.md`](theory/core-framework.md) for theoretical foundation
2. Review [`research/empirical-evidence.md`](research/empirical-evidence.md) for scientific support  
3. Run [`models/python/reciprocal_mirror.py`](models/python/reciprocal_mirror.py) for simulations

## ðŸ”¬ Key Contributions

- **Bidirectional Simultaneity Principle**: Both agents mirror each other simultaneously
- **Four-Phase Structure**: Discrete phases of recognition and understanding
- **Mathematical Formalization**: Formal model with testable predictions
- **Empirical Protocol**: Hyperscanning experiments to validate theory

## ðŸ“š Theoretical Extensions

- **[Emergence Mechanism](theory/emergence-mechanism.md)**: Why simultaneity creates non-linear dynamics
- **[Evolutionary Advantages](theory/evolutionary-advantages.md)**: Survival benefits of relational consciousness  
- **[Edge Cases](theory/edge-cases.md)**: Boundary conditions and special cases
