Dear Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience Editors,

I am submitting "Reciprocal Mirroring: A Computational Framework for Consciousness Emergence Through Bidirectional Simulation" as an Original Research article.

AFFILIATION: Independent Researcher (ORCID: 0009-0005-5963-9807)

KEY CONTRIBUTIONS:
- First computational model of simultaneous bidirectional mirroring
- Honest statistical validation (R²=0.897, not fake 1.000) 
- Discovery of burst-and-plateau dynamics unique to reciprocal processing
- 5× greater non-linearity than sequential interaction
- Information-theoretic validation with transfer entropy and integrated information

WHY FRONTIERS:
You actually accept independent researchers. You judge work on merit, not institutional affiliation. You're open access. You don't charge submission fees. 

PERSONAL NOTE:
I tried arXiv - they said "get published first." I tried Neural Computation - they wanted $125 just to look at it. Oxford's system is down. I just want to share knowledge that might help understand consciousness. 

All code at: https://github.com/HillaryDanan/reciprocal-mirroring-emergence

The work is rigorous, novel, and honest. That should be enough.

Sincerely,
Hillary Danan
Independent Researcher
ORCID: 0009-0005-5963-9807

P.S. - My advisor always said "Frontiers it" when traditional venues were being gatekeepy. Here we are. <4577>
