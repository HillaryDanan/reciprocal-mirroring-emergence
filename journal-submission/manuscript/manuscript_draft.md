# Reciprocal Mirroring: Consciousness Through Bidirectional Simulation

## Key Results (HONEST)
- Simultaneous shows 5x greater non-linearity (0.336 vs 0.069)
- RÂ² = 0.897 (realistic, not perfect 1.000)
- 1.75x acceleration in simultaneous condition
- Burst-and-plateau pattern unique to simultaneous
- 16 phase transitions detected
