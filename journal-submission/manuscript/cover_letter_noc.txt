Dear Editors of Neuroscience of Consciousness,

I am pleased to submit "Reciprocal Mirroring: A Computational Framework for Consciousness Emergence Through Bidirectional Simulation" for consideration at Neuroscience of Consciousness.

This work directly addresses the central question of your journal: how does consciousness emerge? We propose it emerges through reciprocal, simultaneous mirroring between agents—consciousness is fundamentally relational, not computational.

KEY FINDINGS:
- Simultaneous mirroring shows 5× greater non-linearity than sequential
- Characteristic "burst-and-plateau" pattern unique to bidirectional processing  
- Information-theoretic validation with honest statistics (R²=0.897, not fake 1.000)
- 16 phase transitions detected, suggesting rich metastable dynamics

SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY:
We discovered our initial validation was circular (R²=1.000) and completely redid it with honest methods. This transparency strengthens our conclusions.

TESTABLE PREDICTIONS:
- EEG hyperscanning will show burst-plateau gamma synchrony
- Phase transitions at understanding thresholds
- Clinical populations show altered burst-plateau dynamics

This work offers a mathematically rigorous, empirically testable framework for consciousness as relational emergence—perfectly aligned with your journal's mission.

Sincerely,

Hillary Danan

P.S. We chose your journal over others because you don't charge submission fees and you focus on consciousness itself, not just its neural correlates. <4577>
