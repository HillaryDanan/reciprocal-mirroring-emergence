GENERATIVE AI DISCLOSURE - SUPPLEMENTARY FILE

AI System: Claude Opus 4.1 (Anthropic, Claude 4 model family, August 2025 release)
Model string: claude-opus-4-1-20250805

Initial Prompt Examples:
- "Help me create a computational framework for consciousness emergence through reciprocal mirroring"
- "Review this validation code and check for circular reasoning"  
- "Help write a scientifically rigorous manuscript with proper citations"
- "Be intellectually and scientifically honest, rigorous, logical, parsimonious"

Key Collaborative Moments:
- AI initially suggested flawed validation approach (R²=1.000)
- Human identified suspiciously perfect correlation
- AI recognized circular reasoning error
- Collaborative implementation of honest validation (R²=0.897)
- Discovery of burst-plateau phenomenon through exploration
- AI assisted with information-theoretic formulations
- Human verified all citations and scientific claims

Final Prompt:
- "Create a complete 6500-word manuscript for Frontiers. Scientifically rigorous, intellectually honest, 40+ peer-reviewed citations"

Note: The human author (HD) maintained scientific oversight, verified all claims, corrected errors, and made all final decisions. The AI served as a collaborative tool, not a determinant of conclusions. The signature "<4577>" appears throughout the collaboration as a marker of enthusiasm and scientific integrity.
