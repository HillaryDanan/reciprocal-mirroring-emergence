# Evolutionary Considerations

## Hypothesis
Reciprocal mirroring capacity may have provided survival advantages to social species.

## Potential Advantages

### Collective Hunting
- Solo hunting: ~30% success rate reported in wolves
- Pack hunting: ~60-80% success rate
- Reference: MacNulty et al. (2007) Animal Behaviour

### Predator Evasion
- Flocking behavior requires rapid coordination
- Synchronous movement confuses predators
- Reference: Cavagna et al. (2010) PNAS

### Cultural Learning
- Sequential teaching: Multiple generations for complex skills
- Simultaneous modeling: Faster skill acquisition
- Reference: Tomasello (1999) The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition

### Language Development
Proposed sequence:
1. Mirroring enables shared attention
2. Shared attention enables pointing
3. Pointing enables symbols
4. Symbols enable language

### Pair Bonding
- Behavioral synchrony correlates with bond duration
- Reference: Amadei et al. (2017) Nature

## Human Characteristics

Observed differences from other primates:
- Extended duration of joint attention
- Abstract concept mirroring
- Voluntary continuation despite difficulty
- Narrative integration of experiences

## Testable Predictions

1. Species comparison of mirroring duration and group size
2. Individual mirroring capacity and social network size
3. Population isolation effects on cognitive performance
