# Reciprocal Mirroring: Theoretical Framework

## Summary

Mutual understanding emerges from bidirectional, simultaneous mirroring between agents, with iterative choice points determining engagement depth.

## Core Mechanism

When Agent A observes Agent B, A internally simulates B's experience. Simultaneously, B mirrors A's observation quality, creating feedback loops.

## Four-Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Initial Contact
- Surface-level mirror activation
- Initial assessment
- Low neural recruitment

### Phase 2: Deep Simulation Attempt  
- Full simulation attempt
- Complexity discovery
- Neural recruitment expansion

### Phase 3: Complexity Recognition
- Multi-dimensional landscape recognition
- Increased effort investment
- Cross-brain coupling strengthening

### Phase 4: Choice Point
- Continue or disengage decision
- Continued mirroring increases intersubjectivity
- Shared space creation

## Mathematical Formalization

```
S(t) = C_A(t) ∩ C_B(t) × min(U(A,B,t), U(B,A,t))

Where:
- S(t) = Shared space at time t
- C_X(t) = Agent X's state
- U(X,Y,t) = X's understanding of Y at time t
```

## Scientific Foundation

- Mirror neuron systems (Rizzolatti et al., 1996)
- Neural synchrony in interaction (Hasson et al., 2012)
- Simulation theory (Gallese & Goldman, 1998)
- Active inference (Friston & Frith, 2015)

## Testable Predictions

1. Inter-brain synchrony shows discrete phase transitions
2. Choice points have measurable neural signatures
3. Asymmetric understanding leads to unstable dynamics
4. High-synchrony states show gamma-band coupling

## Applications

- Clinical interventions for social cognition
- AI system design
- Educational assessment methods
